# How to contribute

Third-party patches are essential for keeping the autonomous cloud fabric 
great. We simply can't manage the huge number of platforms and myriad 
configurations for running the autonomous cloud fabric. We want to keep it
as easy as possible to contribute changes that get things working in your
environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to 
follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

Please use issues for discussing proposals or to raise a question. If you
have improvements to the autonomous cloud fabric please submit a pull 
request.

Please note that as the project grows over time, so will the contributing
guidelines :-)
